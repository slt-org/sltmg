I would like to announce a new release of the Modeling Glass Toolbox version 1.2. MG Toolbox is an online set of tools for calculating shapes and auto-generating batch recipes. It will help you answer questions like "How much Modeling Glass do I need to make a disk ten inches in diameter?" and "What size piece can I make with my leftover Modeling Glass?".

New features.
* Disk generators and calculators now use diameter instead of radius for input.
* You can now choose your units for each input, choices are inches, millimeters and centimeters.
* Volume calculators now include calculations for the weight of Standard Bullseye glass needed to fill the volume.

The MG Toolbox is free to use and requires no signup.
